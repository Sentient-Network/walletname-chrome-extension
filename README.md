Netkiâ€™s *Wallet Name Resolver* works with web based wallets supporting bitcoin and numerous other blockchain based digital currencies and assets.  Now you can quickly and easily move money between wallets by using a **Wallet Name** instead of a complicated wallet address.

When you can have an *easy to remember*, *easy to share* Wallet Name like:

**batman.tip.me**

You can get a **free** Wallet Name two ways:

1. Contact your wallet provider! We have had Netki Wallet Names installed simply by users asking for this feature. :)
2. Are you on Twitter? Then you already have a Wallet Name via our partner ChangeTip! Go to [www.tip.me](https://www.tip.me) and sign in with your Twitter handle to activate your wallet and automatically get a Wallet Name that you can readily share.

FAQ
------------
**Q:** Why is this Chrome extension listed as beta?

**A:** The Chrome extension currently uses the Netki Public API to perform Wallet Name lookups, which requires DNS + DNSSEC. There is currently no DNSSEC library available in Javascript. We are working to create a DNSSEC library in order to have all lookups performed in a completely decentralized way, from within the browser.

-----

**Q:** Will this extension only lookup Wallet Names registered with Netki?

**A:** This extension will resolve **any** Wallet Name that adheres to the Wallet Name *standard*. The standard is published on the Netki Developers page: [https://www.netki.com/#/developers](https://www.netki.com/#/developers)

**Q:** How can I contact Netki?
